    "“The global interpreter lock, abbreviated GIL and pronounced gill, is a controversial topic in the Python community. Briefly, the GIL prevents one Python process from executing more than one Python bytecode instruction at any given time. This means that even if we have multiple threads on a machine with multiple cores, a Python process can have only one thread running Python code at a time. In a world where we have CPUs with multiple cores, this can pose a significant challenge for Python developers looking to take advantage of multithreading to improve the performance of their application.\n",
